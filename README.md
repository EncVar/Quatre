# Quatre

An extremely poor third-party Tencent QQ client.

The name "Quatre" is from the French word for 4, which pronounces **/kat Å/**. In many languages, 3 represents "more", so the name represents "more than more", or "more plus one more".

This poor client is for those who want to keep connection of domestic platforms (as for Chinese people) without a very bad experience.

Although this client is extremely poor, I bet you can recognize that it is better than official QQ client, if you're really the target user of the client.
